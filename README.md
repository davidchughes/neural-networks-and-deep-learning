# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples from Michael Nielsen's book on ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

I've added a bit to change the data source from mnist to one I generate using printed text on different backgrounds.  This code was never meant to see the outside world so be prepared to see code growth due to hacks on hacks.  This dirty laundry is meant to show the fact that I can at least write code but unfortunately it may cast doubt on my ability to write code well. It mostly shows that I can kludge together a proof of concept to validate my notions of how to attack a problem.
